To Run Berkelely DB JE 3.0.12 there are three requirments: 

 1- ant (you can download ant-1.8.2.jar).
 2- javax (you can download javax.resource-api-1.7.jar).
 3- Fix Junit testing Junit3 to resolve the issue regarding "Assert cannot be resolved".

I use the following modification on Eclipse IDE :
Version: Photon Release (4.8.0)
Java version: 11.0.6 (You can run Berkelely DB JE 3.0.12 on older version of Java like 1.5)
