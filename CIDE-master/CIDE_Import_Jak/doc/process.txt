Import works in multiple steps:

* first, a FeatureHouse extension is used to flatten all files and introduce annotations as textual comments

* second, the result and the feature model is moved into a newly created java project in the workspace

* third, the guidsl feature model is extended to include all OR features

* fourth, the textual annotations are read and removed, while their content is applied to the AST

* finally, a pretty printing step would be a good idea.
