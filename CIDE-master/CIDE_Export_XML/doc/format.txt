A project consists of three parts

a) the source code (src directory)
b) a feature model (model.m)
c) annotations (annotations.xml)


Feature model
-------------


Description of the Feature Model format see:

http://wwwiti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/iti_db/lehre/epmd/2008/misc/guidsl.html

A parser for this format, written in Java, can be provided.



Annotations
-----------

All annotations are written in a single annotations.xml file for better parsing. 
The annotations reference the feature names from the feature model.


In the current format, a file is split into non-overlapping fragments. So if there is an outer annotation on a class with feature X and an inner annotation on a method with feature Y, there will be three fragments: one before the method annotated with X, one describing the method annotated with X *and* Y, and a third one after the method annotated with X. That is, as a developer, you do not have to care about nesting or overlapping.
If you need a different format (e.g., where only the original annotations are stored) contact me.


Generally the file has a very simple, self-explaining structure:

<project name="...">
	<folder name="x">
		<feature>x</feature>
		<file "file.java">
			<feature>x</feature>
			<fragment offset="11" length="23"><feature>x</feature></fragment>
		</file>
	...
	

The DTD specification:
	
<!ELEMENT project (feature|folder|file)*>
<!ATTLIST project   name   CDATA    #REQUIRED >
<!ELEMENT folder (feature|folder|file)*>
<!ATTLIST folder name   CDATA    #REQUIRED >
<!ELEMENT file (feature|fragment)*>
<!ATTLIST file  name   CDATA    #REQUIRED >
<!ELEMENT fragment (feature)*>
<!ATTLIST fragment  offset   CDATA    #REQUIRED  length   CDATA    #REQUIRED >
<!ELEMENT feature (#PCDATA)>
