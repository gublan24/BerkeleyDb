# Berkeley DB (Umple)

## Description
This repo has a compositional SPL version of Berkeley DB JE in Umple. It was refacttoed from a version written in FeatureHouse. Mixsets are used to represent features of  SPL Berkeley DB. Initial translation to Umple was accomplished by Umplificator. Then we transformed each featureâ€™s fragments written in FeatureHouse code into mixset fragments.

##  Installation
There two simple requirements : 
 1. Download or clone this repo.
 2. Download [Umple.jar](https://cruise.eecs.uottawa.ca/umpleonline/download_eclipse_umple_plugin.shtml). 

 
## Usage
 Use Umple command line : `java -jar UMPLE_JAR_DIR/umple.jar BerkeleyDb_DIR/src/MainUmpleMaster.ump` to generate an SPL variant. Where UMPLE_JAR_DIR is the directory containing umple.jar and BerkeleyDb_DIR is the directory containing this repo code. 
 
To run Berkelely DB JE 3.0.12 (Code generated in Java), there are three requirements: 
 1. ant (you can use ant-1.8.2.jar).  
 2. Javax (you can use javax.resource-api-1.7.jar).  
 3. Fix Junit testing Junit3 to resolve the issue regarding "Assert cannot be resolved".

I've used Eclipse IDE :
 - Version: Photon Release (4.8.0) 
 - Java JDK version: You can run Berkelely DB JE 3.0.12 on old version of JDK like 1.5.

## Contents of the directories
This project is split into many smaller subprojects; the folder hierarchy is explained below to better describe the structure.
 * **src**/
The src folder includes the source code of Berkeley DB in Umple format. The src folder contains the **Features**/ and their interaction in **Feature_Interaction**/. 
 * **alternative_imp**/
 The alternative_imp folder contains the original source code of Berkeley DB JE, [CIDE](https://github.com/ckaestne/CIDE/tree/master/CIDE_Samples/cide_samples/Berkeley%20DB%20JE) implementation, and FeatureHouse Implementation.  
 * **umplificator**/ 
It includes a jar file "umplificator.jar" that we've used to reverse engineer Java code to Umple.
