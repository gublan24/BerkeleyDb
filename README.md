# Berkeley DB (Umple)

## Description
This repo offers an SPL compositional version of Berkeley DB JE writen in Umple. It was refactored from a FeatureHouse implementaion. Mixsets are used to represent the features of the Berkeley DB. Initial translation to Umple was accomplished by Umplificator. Then each each featureâ€™s fragments are refactored into mixset fragments.

##  Installation
There two simple requirements : 
 1. Download or clone this repo.
 2. Download [Umple.jar](https://cruise.eecs.uottawa.ca/umpleonline/download_eclipse_umple_plugin.shtml). 

 
## Usage
 Use Umple command line : `java -jar UMPLE_JAR_DIR/umple.jar BerkeleyDb_DIR/src/umpleMaster.ump` to generate an SPL variant. Where UMPLE_JAR_DIR is the directory containing umple.jar and BerkeleyDb_DIR is the directory containing this repo code. The SPL variant is specified in 'src/configuration/SPLVariaintConfig.ump'. 
 
To run Berkelely DB JE 3.0.12 (Code generated in Java), there are three requirements: 
 1. ant (you can use ant-1.8.2.jar).  
 2. Javax (you can use javax.resource-api-1.7.jar).  
 3. Fix Junit testing Junit3 to resolve the issue regarding "Assert cannot be resolved".

I've used Eclipse IDE :
 - Version: Photon Release (4.8.0) 
 - Java JDK version: You can run Berkelely DB JE 3.0.12 on old version of JDK like 1.5.

## Contents of the directories
This project is split into many smaller subprojects; the folder hierarchy is explained below to better describe the structure.
 * **src**
The src folder includes the source code of Berkeley DB in Umple format. The src folder contains the **Features** and their interaction in **Feature_Interaction**. 
 * **alternative_imp**
 The alternative_imp folder contains the original source code of Berkeley DB JE, [CIDE](https://github.com/ckaestne/CIDE/tree/master/CIDE_Samples/cide_samples/Berkeley%20DB%20JE) implementation, and [FeatureHouse](https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE/tree/develop/plugins/de.ovgu.featureide.examples/featureide_examples/BerkeleyDB-FH-Java) Implementation.  
 * **umplificator**/ 
It includes a jar file "umplificator.jar" that we've used to reverse engineer Java code to Umple.
